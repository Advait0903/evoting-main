## Workflow

- The administrator will launch/deploy the system in a blockchain network (EVM), build a voting instance, then create an election instance, start the election, and fill in the election's specifics (including candidates for voters to vote on).
- The potential voters then sign up to vote on the same blockchain network by connecting to it. After successfully registering, users' information is forwarded to or presented in the administrator's panel (i.e., the verification page) for review.
- The administrator will then verify that the registration data, including the name, address of the blockchain account, and phone number is accurate and matches his records. If so, the administrator gives the registered user the go-ahead to participate in the election and cast their particular vote.
- After receiving admin approval, a registered user (voter) uses the voting page to cast their ballot for the candidate of their choice.
- Depending on the size of the election, the administration ends the election after a while. The voting is then closed, and the results are shown, with the winner's name at the top of the results page.
